        <p>
            This is a history of my work experience, my education, and any relevent information that normally gets put on a resume. References available on request, but honestly does anyone actually call the people I put on there?

                                                    This client came to us with a very important request: help us meet requirements mandated by the State of New York in a few months, or else we'll get our funding pulled. The piece of the puzzle that I helped solve was building a custom form builder that integrated with their Health Information Exchange, and got it deployed to production in three months. I also helped tune the performance of the monolith application in production that would become the flagship for the organization.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    Once the state requirements were met, I was the primary architect on the Keyhole side that was responsible for converting the monolith over to a scaleable solution. Scaleable in terms of both the number of end users as well as the number of developers that could concurrently be working on features at the same time. The API I helped design was based on the Microservices pattern, which fit in nicely with the client's functional requirements. The UI I helped design was based on Backbone.js with emphasis on hash-based routing and orchestration via a custom Controller class.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                   Technical leadership was only one of my responsibilities while at this client. The leadership was in a state of flux, this was the first time they had ever developed custom software, and the organization as a whole wasn't sure if they wanted to be in the custom software business. Managing expectation, keeping the architectural vision pure and consistent, and helping grow a small team into a bona fide development shop were all things I helped with during my tenure.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    Much of my current leadership skills came from my time at this client. I got to interact with a wide range of personalities and technical skill levels. I was responsible for the success of the project as well as the success of Keyhole at the client as a whole. I worked to get new Statements of Work for Keyhole at the client. I pushed myself much farther than I thought possible when I made the leap to East Coast development.

                                                    The very first client I was on at Keyhole had a very interesting requirement for our project: take an existing Flash-based application to manage a mutual fund account holder's assets, and convert it to HTML5/JavaScript. This was my first foray into consulting, and gave me the opportunity to really bite my teeth into it. I was one of a few Keyhole developers on the project, but ended up being the last to leave because the client liked me too much to let me go easily.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    The API work I did on this was minimal as there were no data model or API contract changes needed between the Flash version and the one we were building. The primary UI technology on this was ExtJS, which I had used for many years prior to this project. As the ExtJS expert, I got to train the client's developers on this team as well as other teams in the company. The code we wrote was eventally used as the basis for a platform that other teams would go on to use even after we left.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    I learned that as a consultant there are several different hats that you must wear depending on the situation. The way you interact with developers on a team needs to differ from how you interact with enterprise architects. Interacting with C-suite executives also has to be done differently. This client had all of the above, and was a great first step into consulting.
