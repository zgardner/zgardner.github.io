		<h1>RFC ZACH</h1>
        <p>
            One of the most famous things I've ever created is RFC ZACH. This standard contains all of my beliefs on best practices for web development as well as programming and life in general. If you've worked with me for more than a few hours, I'll have probably mentioned something from this document. It started out as a joke because I am very opinionated, but it has evolved into something I can fully stand behind.

                            The purpose of an API should be to provide data for consumers of the API. They should be easy for consumers to call, which means clear and concise documentation, as well as consistent. The API contract is scared, so it should be easy for the language which implements the API to define the contract as well the software which enables the API should be able to enforce the contract.

                            A fundamental aspect of the API contract which should always be given consideration before finalizing is an agreement on the meta aspects of the API. The most important meta aspects are listed in order of their importance: performance, availability, notification of change. Performance is the most critical as a honest agreement on performance is critical gaining and keeping the trust of the stakeholders of consumers of the API. Availability has a large impact on cost as well as architecture, so having a clear understanding between the API designers and its consumers will make sure <a href="#life-communication">expectations are met.</a>

                            JavaScript exists to breathe life into static pages in a way that provides positive value to end users. It allows developers to get so close to the end user's experience that care should be taken to ensure quality code is delivered. A concerted effort should be taken to ensure the negative aspects of JavaScript are not abused, and that maintainable code is the output of all work.

                            The ability to effectively communicate greatly determines a person's success both in terms of career success as well as personal success. Communication is a skill that is worth the effort to learn and perfect.

                        <p>
                            Communication plays an essential role in every aspect of life. The clearer two parties are in their communication, the less friction between them there will be. The principles of managing expectations and following through with commitments rely heavily on the ability to effectively communicate.

                            <a href="#apis-purpose">Defining and enforcing the API contract</a> is fundamental to an API's purpose. Every other server-side language mentioned in this RFC outside of Node.js has mature and stable API frameworks that to an extent easily allow developers to define the model requirements, and throw exceptions when the consumer of the API violates the request contract. To the best of my knowledge, this level of API contract definition and enforcement is precariously missing from any Node.js API framework.

                            <a href="#javascript-purpose">JavaScript's purpose</a> is to allow developers to transform static pages into a dynamic experience that is positive for end users. It was designed to allow for a flexable definition of code through mechanisms like prototypal inheritance and loose typing. This flexability comes with a cost in terms of performance. Boxing and unboxing variables along with other implementation details of being an interpreted language mean it is not an optimal choice where performance is concerned. Thus, <a href="#apis-service-level-agreements">defining and meeting SLAs</a> is difficult due to the performance of the language itself.
