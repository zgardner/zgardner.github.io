		<p>
			This is my static GitHub site. I've tried out various options in the past (e.g. Wordpress), but they've never seemed to stick (i.e. I had to pay for them). Trying this out to serve as a landing page to know everything about me.
		</p>
		<p>
			Things I like:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Programming (JavaScript, SASS, HTML, SQL, Java, .NET, PHP)
				</li>
				<li>
					Books (High Fantasy)
				</li>
				<li>
					Mowing my lawn
				</li>
			</ul>

			I work for <a href="https://keyholesoftware.com">Keyhole Software</a> in Kansas City as a HTML5/JavaScript consultant.
