            This is my static GitHub site. I've tried out various options in the past (e.g. Wordpress), but they've never seemed to stick (i.e. I had to pay for them). Trying this out to serve as a landing page to know everything about me.

            Do not judge me based on my GitHub account. I rarely do much open source work as I am too busy with working on real projects that solve real issues, or I am workng on being a father.
